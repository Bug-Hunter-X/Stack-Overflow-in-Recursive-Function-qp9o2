This repository contains a Hack program demonstrating a potential stack overflow error. The `foo` function is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. If the input number `x` is too large, the function will recurse too many times, leading to a stack overflow. The `bar` function calls `foo` and handles the negative input. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions and shows how the stack overflow could happen. The solution demonstrates how to avoid the stack overflow by using iteration instead of recursion.
